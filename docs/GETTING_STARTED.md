# Getting Started with "My" â€” Step-by-step (very simple)

This guide explains how to get the scaffold running on a PC, on Termux (Android), and alternatives. It also explains how to connect optional cloud resources such as Hugging Face or Google Cloud. It's written simply so a 10-year-old can follow.

Important: This scaffold is an initial starting point. The real AI engine and automated builders are large systems that will be added incrementally. Use this guide to run the local scaffolding and understand the architecture.

1) On a PC (Linux / macOS / Windows with WSL)
- Install Git and Docker.
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Johnshah/My.git`
- Enter the folder: `cd My`
- Start local services: `docker compose up --build`
- Open http://localhost:3000 (frontend placeholder)

2) On Android using Termux (quick guide)
- Install Termux from F-Droid (do NOT use Play Store copies if outdated).
- In Termux, run:
  - `pkg update && pkg upgrade`
  - `pkg install git nodejs python docker` (Note: Docker on Termux may require root or special setups; Termux alternatives are below.)
  - `git clone https://github.com/Johnshah/My.git`
  - `cd My`
  - Follow the same local steps; if Docker is not available, run the backend and frontend locally with Node/Python commands (see individual service READMEs).

3) Termux alternatives (if Docker or native packages don't work)
- UserLAnd (app that provides a Linux distro on Android)
- Andronix (scripted distro install)
- Use a remote build server or a PC and SSH from Android to run builds

4) Connect to Hugging Face or other model hosts (optional)
- Create a Hugging Face account and a token.
- Store your token in a local config file: `~/.my/config` and never commit secrets.
- The scaffold will look for `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables.

5) Google Cloud / Cloud acceleration (optional)
- Create a GCP project, enable required services, and generate API keys or service accounts.
- Use them only for optional acceleration; default operation should be local and free.

6) Building for Android (general overview)
- The scaffold supports Capacitor / React Native options.
- For a specific device such as the Poco X6 Pro (MediaTek Dimensity 8300 Ultra), builds are standard Android builds. Install Android Studio and SDKs on a PC, then use Capacitor/Electron tooling to produce an APK.

7) Next steps
- Add your desired model runtimes to ai_engine/.
- Wire multi-agent orchestrators in ai_engine/agents/.
- Open PRs to contribute integrations!
