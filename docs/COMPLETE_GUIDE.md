pkg upgrade

# This might take 5-10 minutes, be patient!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: "Command not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Install missing tool
pkg install <tool-name>

# Common:
pkg install git
pkg install python
pkg install nodejs
```

**Issue 2: "Permission denied"**
```bash
# Solution: Add execute permission
chmod +x filename.sh
```

**Issue 3: "Port already in use"**
```bash
# Solution: Kill process on that port
pkill -f python
pkill -f node

# Or use different port:
python main.py --port 8001
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

**Issue 4: "Out of memory" on Android**
```bash
# Solution: Clear some space
apt clean
npm cache clean --force
pip cache purge
```

**Issue 5: "Cannot connect to backend"**
- Check backend is running: `ps aux | grep python`
- Check frontend API URL in `next.config.js`
- Make sure both on same network

**Issue 6: "Build failed for Android"**
- Need Android SDK (large download!)
- Or use cloud build service
- Or build on PC and transfer APK

### Getting Help

**1. Check Logs**
```bash
# Backend logs
cd ~/My/backend
python main.py > logs.txt 2>&1

# Frontend logs
cd ~/My/frontend
npm run dev > logs.txt 2>&1
```

**2. Ask on GitHub Issues**
https://github.com/Johnshah/My/issues
