# My — The Free Universal AI App Generator

"My" is an open-source, offline-first AI platform that helps generate real, working apps (web, mobile, backend, full-stack) from a GitHub repo link, uploaded project, or natural-language prompt. This repository is the starter scaffold: architecture overview, onboarding docs, and placeholders for frontend, backend and AI engine components.

GOAL
- Make "My" 100% free, open-source, and runnable locally with optional cloud acceleration.
- Support multiple open models and multi-agent orchestration to build, test, package and deploy apps automatically.

QUICK START (for beginners / 10-year-old friendly)
1. Clone your repo: git clone https://github.com/Johnshah/My.git
2. Open the folder: cd My
3. Read docs/GETTING_STARTED.md for simple step-by-step instructions (Termux, PC, Hugging Face, Google Cloud, and alternatives).
4. Run the initial scaffold checks: bash scripts/check_scaffold.sh (coming soon)
